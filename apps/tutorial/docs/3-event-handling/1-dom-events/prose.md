As seen previously, `on` was used to listen for `click` events on a button.

The `on` modifier can be thought of as an alias for [`addEventListener`][mdn-addEventListener], so anything it can do, `on` can do.

For example, try observing the x / y coordinates of the mouse on this div:

```hbs 
<div {{on 'mousemove' handleMouseMove}}>
  The mouse position is {{m.x}} x {{m.y}}
</div>
```

When moving the cursor over the div, the rendered coordinates should update.
