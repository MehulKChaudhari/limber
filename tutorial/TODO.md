TODOs:
 - write tests that ensure that limber can be loaded with both the prompt and answer
   (without error -- or provide a way to _expect_ an error)
 - use https://github.com/empress/bottled-ember to generate an app
    - define a template for this app 
    - provide a custom bin for this generation process
